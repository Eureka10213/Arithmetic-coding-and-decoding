when discussing online social networks push people closer or further apart  we have to draw results from the shaping and influence of social media on peoples behavior we will only look at the influence of social media on the behavior of people with normal communication skills then  i will refute three opposing views to support my view social media brings people closer some people argue that social media restricts the way of communicating  making people increasingly dependent on social media for communication however the reason why people rely on social media is that it provides people with a more efficient and convenient way to communicate for example  we use qq groups and wechat groups to post some notifications  and even use them for online meetings when taking some courses and doing some group projects these have greatly improved our work efficiency with the increase in work intensity and the development of social media technology  we use them more and more frequently  but this does not mean that this limits the way of communicating because social media is only used as a means of assisting communication when the cost of face to face communication is high  it is a wise choice to choose a cheaper and more convenient communication method in some cases  we make a suitable choice  but we cannot say that this suitable choice limits the less suitable choices some people believe that social media allows people to have more friends in the virtual world  but lose some friends in the real world they say people will allocate more time to friends on the internet  and gradually ignore friends in reality  but in fact many friends on the internet have never met i agree with this phenomenon  but it is absurd to attribute it to social media in fact  we are constantly losing some friends the possible reasons are various for example  we and our friends are not in the same school or in the same city  and we cannot chat  eat and play together often sometimes the busy study and work pace make us forget to interact with our previous friends such a relationship has become rusty however  this has nothing to do with social media we should reflect on ourselves  why cant we spare some time to greet and care about some former friends in fact  social media provides us with opportunities we can start with a simple wechat emoticon package to chat with friends and increase relationships in the era of underdeveloped communications  after parting with friends  it was really difficult to connect  and technology completely changed this situation others insist that social media makes people lose their basic communication skills they will ask us to imagine a scenario where a group of people gather  each playing on their mobile phones  and no one speaks however it is unfair to blame social media for no one speaks have they ever thought about such a situation everyone is not very familiar with each other  and there is no common topic  but they have to sit together or some of them have tried to find the topic  but no one responded indeed  talking about topics that are not of interest to everyone will make the scene very embarrassing  and looking at the phone is indeed a very good way to relieve embarrassment  because everyone is doing the same thing therefore  i do not advocate that only chat is a good way to get along with others keeping silent after expressing basic greetings is better than offensive and embarrassing chat its better to use social media to discover the people youre really interested in and leave time for them  isnt it social media is just a technology  technology itself is neutral  we need to see how people use it social media makes distance no longer an obstacle to peoples communication we can use social media to make work teams more efficient to improve team cohesion  and distances between members are closer we can use social media to greet an old friends to maintain a friendship and the distances between friends are closer we can use social media to communicate with anyone we want to get close to  instead of confining to the uninterested people around us  and the distances between our and the world are closer
